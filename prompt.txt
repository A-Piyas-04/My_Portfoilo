You are an expert full-stack engineer, senior front-end architect, UI/UX designer, and technical writer.
Your task is to build a complete, production-ready personal portfolio website for a Software Developer using the exact stack and structure described below.

🔧 TECHNOLOGY STACK (strict)

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

This must be a static, SEO-friendly, lightweight portfolio.

 ├── Footer.jsx
 ├── HeroSection.jsx
